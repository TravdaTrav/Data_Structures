//Bottom-up Heapify (first draft)

//for loop has time complexity O(n) which makes a "heapified" heap

n = numElements;

//Find the index of the last parent node by finding the parent of the last leaf node
p = numElements / 2;

//Begin heapify at the last parent node because a leaf cannot sink
for (int i = p; i >= 1; --i) {
    sink(data, i); //data is the name of the heap array
}
